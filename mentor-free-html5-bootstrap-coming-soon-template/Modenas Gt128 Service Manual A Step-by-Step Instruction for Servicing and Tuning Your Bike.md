However, like any other vehicle, the Modenas Gt128 requires regular maintenance and servicing to keep it in good condition and performance. In this article, we will provide some tips and guidelines on how to maintain your Modenas Gt128 motorcycle, based on the official service manual[^3^] and some online sources[^2^] [^4^].
 
## Check the Engine Oil Level
 
The engine oil is essential for lubricating the moving parts of the engine and preventing overheating. You should check the engine oil level every time before riding your motorcycle, and change it every 3000 km or 6 months, whichever comes first. To check the engine oil level, follow these steps:
 
1. Park your motorcycle on a level surface and turn off the engine.
2. Remove the oil filler cap/dipstick from the right side of the engine.
3. Wipe off any oil from the dipstick with a clean cloth.
4. Insert the dipstick into the oil filler hole without screwing it in.
5. Pull out the dipstick and check the oil level. It should be between the upper and lower marks on the dipstick.
6. If the oil level is low, add the recommended oil (SAE 10W-40) through the oil filler hole until it reaches the upper mark. Do not overfill.
7. Screw in the oil filler cap/dipstick securely.

## Clean the Air Filter
 
The air filter prevents dust and dirt from entering the engine and affecting its performance. You should clean the air filter every 6000 km or 12 months, whichever comes first. To clean the air filter, follow these steps:

1. Remove the seat by unlocking it with the ignition key.
2. Remove the air cleaner cover by loosening the screws.
3. Remove the air filter element from the air cleaner case.
4. Clean the air filter element by tapping it gently on a hard surface to remove any dust or dirt. Do not use compressed air or wash it with water or solvent.
5. Inspect the air filter element for any damage or wear. If it is damaged or excessively dirty, replace it with a new one.
6. Install the air filter element into the air cleaner case.
7. Install the air cleaner cover and tighten the screws.
8. Install the seat and lock it with the ignition key.

## Adjust the Drive Chain
 
The drive chain transmits power from the engine to the rear wheel. You should check and adjust the drive chain every 1000 km or monthly, whichever comes first. To adjust the drive chain, follow these steps:

1. Park your motorcycle on its center stand on a level surface.
2. Measure the drive chain slack at its loosest point by pushing it up and down with your finger. The slack should be between 15 mm and 25 mm.
3. If the slack is out of specification, loosen the rear axle nut and turn both chain adjusters equally until you get the desired slack. Make sure that both sides of
the rear wheel are aligned with each other by using
the alignment marks on
the swingarm.
4. Tighten
the rear axle nut to
the specified torque (65 Nm).

Note: If the drive chain is too tight, it will cause excessive wear and damage to the chain and sprockets. If the drive chain is too loose, it will cause noise and vibration, and may come off the sprockets.
