The following albums, Luna (1983), Yassassin (1984), 17 Re (1986), Litfiba 3 (1988), and Pirata (1989), continued to explore different musical styles and themes, such as reggae, funk, Middle Eastern music, politics, and mythology. Some of the most popular songs from this period include "Istanbul", "Re del silenzio", "Cangaceiro", "Proibito", and "Tex". The band also gained more popularity and recognition, both nationally and internationally, thanks to their energetic live performances and their participation in festivals such as Rock in Roma and Sanremo.
  
## The Commercial Peak Phase (1990-1997)
  
The commercial peak phase of Litfiba was characterized by their shift to a more mainstream and accessible sound, influenced by bands such as U2, The Rolling Stones, and Guns N' Roses. Their sixth album, El Diablo (1990), was their first to reach the top of the Italian charts and to sell over one million copies. The album featured songs such as "El diablo", "Sparami", "Lo spettacolo", and "Vivere il mio tempo". The album also marked the beginning of a trilogy of albums inspired by the elements of fire, water, and earth.
  
The second album of the trilogy, Terremoto (1993), was another huge success for Litfiba, selling over two million copies and becoming one of the best-selling albums in Italian history. The album featured songs such as "Il vento", "Lacio drom", "Prima guardia", and "Goccia a goccia". The album also showcased the band's ability to blend hard rock with Latin rhythms and melodies.
  
The third and final album of the trilogy, Spirito (1994), was a more experimental and introspective work, dealing with themes such as spirituality, death, and rebirth. The album featured songs such as "Spirito", "Lo spazio di un attimo", "Regina di cuori", and "Prendi in mano i tuoi anni". The album was less successful than its predecessors, but still received positive reviews from critics and fans.
  
The last album of Litfiba's commercial peak phase was Mondi Sommersi (1997), a concept album based on Jules Verne's novel Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea. The album featured songs such as "L'impossibile", "Sole nero", "Il volo", and "Luce che trema". The album was well received by critics but failed to match the sales of their previous albums.
