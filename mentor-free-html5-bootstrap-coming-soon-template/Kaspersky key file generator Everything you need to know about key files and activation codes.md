## What is a Key File and an Activation Code?
 
A key file is a file that contains the license certificate for your Kaspersky product. It allows you to activate the product offline, without connecting to the Internet. A key file is useful if you have limited or no Internet access, or if you want to install the product on multiple devices without entering the activation code each time[^3^].
 
An activation code is a 20-digit code that you receive when you purchase a Kaspersky product. It is used to activate the product online, by connecting to the Kaspersky servers. An activation code can be converted into a key file using the Kaspersky website[^1^].
