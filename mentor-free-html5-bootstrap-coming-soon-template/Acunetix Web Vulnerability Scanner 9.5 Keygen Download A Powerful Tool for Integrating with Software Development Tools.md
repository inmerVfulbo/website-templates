# How to Use Acunetix Web Vulnerability Scanner 9.5 to Secure Your Website

The installation process will take a few minutes and will require a restart of your computer.
  
## Run Acunetix Web Vulnerability Scanner 9.5
  
After installing Acunetix Web Vulnerability Scanner 9.5, you can launch it from the Start menu or from the desktop shortcut. You will see the main interface of the software, which consists of three main sections: Scan Targets, Scan Results, and Reports.
